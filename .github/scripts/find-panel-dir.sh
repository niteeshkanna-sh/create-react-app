# Finds the directory that holds the admin panel, by looking for config.php.
#
# Why this exists: an FTP path is walked from the account's *login* directory,
# which is not the filesystem root. The path hPanel's File Manager shows --
# /home/uNNNNNNN/domains/.../public_html/admin -- is therefore not the path the
# deploy needs, and there is no way to convert one into the other from the
# outside. Every attempt to guess it cost a round trip through a human, and the
# guesses that "worked" were worse than the ones that failed: the deploy action
# creates directories it cannot find, so a wrong path silently produced a second
# copy of the whole panel in a folder nobody serves.
#
# So stop guessing and go look. config.php is the fingerprint: it holds the
# database password, it is gitignored, and no deploy has ever written it -- so
# it exists only where the panel was really installed.
#
# Prints the panel's path, relative to the login directory and with a trailing
# slash, on stdout. Everything else goes to stderr, so the caller can capture
# the path alone. Exits non-zero if there is not exactly one answer.
#
# Directory names go to the log; credentials never do. This repository is
# public.

# guards blocks the work without protecting anything -- an earlier version did
