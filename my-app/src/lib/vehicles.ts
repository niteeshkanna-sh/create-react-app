/**
 * Fleet loading.
 *
 * Vehicles live in the admin panel's database, which is the single place they
 * are managed. The public endpoint returns only cars whose status is Available
 * and only public-safe columns, so adding a car in the panel puts it on the
 * site and setting one to Maintenance takes it off.
 *
 * cars.ts remains as a fallback: if the API is unreachable the site shows
 * whatever is in that file rather than an error. It is empty by default, which
 * degrades to the "ask us what's available" state.
