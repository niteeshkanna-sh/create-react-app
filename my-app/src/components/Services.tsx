/**
 * What we hire, as a rail that moves on its own.
 *
 * Six cards in a three-wide grid is two rows, and the second row is under the
 * fold on a laptop and a long way down on a phone -- so half of what the
 * business does was seen only by somebody who kept scrolling. In a rail they
 * all go past on their own, and a card leaving the frame is what says there
 * is more of it.
 *
 * The first few cards are rendered again after the list and the crawl wraps
 * where that repeat begins, so the loop is seamless. How that works, and everything else the rail does about
 * hover, focus, touch and reduced motion, is in lib/useRailCrawl -- shared
 * with the places rail on the home page rather than written twice.
 *
 * `showHeading` is off where a page banner has just said the same words: a
 * heading repeating the title directly above it reads as a rendering fault
 * rather than as a section.
