 * The mark in the header, and nothing beside it.
 *
 * It used to be the mark plus PREMIUM RENTALS over the business name in live
 * text. That made sense while there was no logo: the words were the logo. It
 * stopped making sense the moment a real one arrived, because this one has the
 * name drawn into it -- so the header was saying "NiteSha Cars & Bikes" twice,
 * once as artwork and once as type, in two faces at two sizes.
 *
 * The full lockup rather than the emblem, precisely because the text is gone:
 * with no words beside it, the mark has to carry the name itself. It is set
 * large enough that it does, which makes the header taller than a wordmark
 * would -- the cost of a logo with its name drawn in.
 *
 * Alt text rather than aria-hidden, for the same reason. There is no longer a
 * written name for a screen reader to find, so the picture has to supply it.
 *
 * The monogram and the old wordmark stay as the fallback for a site with no
 * logo at all, which is what this was before the owner sent one.
