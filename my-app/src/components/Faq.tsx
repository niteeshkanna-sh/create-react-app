/**
 * The questions people ask before they book.
 *
 * Here because they are asked on the phone every day, and because a page that
 * answers a question in the words somebody typed is the page that gets found.
 * "Do I need a deposit for a self drive car in Nagercoil" is a search; a
 * tariff table is not an answer to it.
 *
 * <details> rather than a pile of JavaScript: it opens and closes with no
 * script at all, it is keyboard-operable and announced correctly without any
 * work, and -- the part that matters here -- the answers are in the HTML
 * whether they are open or shut, so a crawler reads every one of them.
 *
 * The same questions are turned into FAQPage structured data at build time by
 * scripts/prerender-seo.mjs, which builds each page's list exactly the way
 * this does -- same source, same slice. Google asks that such data match what
 * the page shows, and one list built twice from one rule is how that stays
 * true.
 *
 * No question is answered at two URLs. The home page takes the first six of
 * the panel's; the tariff page asks its own six about the table above it and
 * then picks up the panel's from the seventh. Before that split the tariff
 * page rendered all ten, so six questions and six answers were claimed by
 * both pages -- and of a duplicate pair Google shows one and the other earns
 * nothing.
 *
 * Panels of the band's own navy rather than cream cards. Ten pale blocks on a
 * dark photograph read as a stack of paper dropped on the page -- the section
 * fought the banner behind it and won, which is not what a photograph is for.
 * Lit from within instead, with a gold hairline, it sits in the band.
