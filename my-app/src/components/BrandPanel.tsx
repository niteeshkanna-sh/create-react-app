/** The mark on its own, without the name under it.
 *
 *  The header writes the business name out beside it in live text, which stays
 *  crisp at any size and is what a search result quotes. The full lockup's own
 *  wordmark next to that is the same name twice -- and at header height its
 *  "CARS & BIKES" line is a few pixels tall and unreadable anyway. */

/**
 * What a page shows where it has nothing to list yet.
 *
 * Three pages were carrying a white box with a sentence in it, in the middle
 * of a band of cream two or three times its height -- and the pages with the
 * least to say are the ones a stranger is most likely to land on from a
 * search. An empty page is not a reason for the page to look unfinished.
 *
 * So: the logo, on navy, with the line the page wanted to say and the two ways
 * to ask. Navy and not cream because this logo is a dark-background mark --
 * "CARS & BIKES" is set in white in it, and on a light panel that line simply
 * disappears. That is a property of the artwork, not a preference.
 *
 * The mark is uploadable like everything else; the committed file is what the
 * owner supplied.
