 * The four things worth knowing about hiring here, on the about page.

 * Cards shaped like folders, stepped down and up across the row, in the four
 * colours the site already uses -- navy, cream, gold, bronze. A row of four
 * identical white boxes is what every other rental site in the district has;
 * this is the page where the business is allowed to look like itself.
 *
 * The words are the panel's, including the numbers. "1000+ customers" and
 * "20+ vehicles" are claims that change, and a claim written into a component
 * is a claim nobody can correct without a deploy.
