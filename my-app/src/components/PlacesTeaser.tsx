/**
 * Where people go, as a rail that moves on its own.
 *
 * It was three cards in a three-wide grid, which meant the home page named
 * three of the district's places and stopped. The rest were behind a link,
 * and a link is a decision somebody has to make before they have seen
 * anything worth deciding about.
 *
 * All of them go past instead, four at a time, and a card leaving the frame
 * is what says there are more. Four rather than three because these cards are
 * a picture, a line of category and a sentence -- narrower than the service
 * cards and perfectly readable at a quarter of the column, where three left
 * each one wider than it had anything to fill with.
 *
 * The crawl, and everything it does about hover, focus, touch and reduced
 * motion, is lib/useRailCrawl, shared with the services rail. The first few
 * places are rendered again after the list so the loop has somewhere to wrap;
 * that repeat is scenery -- out of the tab order, out of the accessibility
 * tree, and with its pictures unnamed, so a screen reader is read one set of
 * places rather than the same set twice.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all when the list is empty, rather than an empty
 * heading. A section that says "places to visit" above white space is worse
 * than no section.
