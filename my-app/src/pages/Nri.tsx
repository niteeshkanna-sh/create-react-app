/**
 * For visitors coming from abroad.
 *
 * Kanyakumari district sends a lot of people to the Gulf, Singapore and
 * Malaysia, and they come back for weddings, the December holidays and family
 * occasions. Their problems are not a local customer's problems: they are
 * booking months ahead from another country, landing at an airport in a
 * different state, and often need a vehicle for weeks rather than days.
 *
 * The offers here are deliberately written without figures. The owner chose
 * to give a long-stay discount and airport pickup, but has not set the terms,
 * and a percentage on a live page is a promise a customer can hold them to.
 * Add the numbers once they are decided.

              If the trip is for a wedding, tell us early. Muhurtham dates fill
              up months ahead, and families usually need more than one vehicle —
              a decorated car for the couple and others for relatives arriving
              from out of town. We can arrange the lot together so it is one
              conversation rather than five.
