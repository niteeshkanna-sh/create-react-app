/**
 * TODO for the owner: the copy below is deliberately generic. It states only
 * what the booking flow actually does, because inventing a founding year, a
 * fleet size or customer numbers would put claims on the site that are not
 * true. Replace each paragraph with the real story.
 *
 * The sections added since say more without saying anything new: how a hire
 * is actually run, and which towns are covered. Both are true of the business
 * as the rest of the site already describes it, which is the only kind of
 * detail that can be added to an about page by somebody who does not work
 * there.

            Rates are quoted per day and come down for longer rentals. Each
            vehicle carries a daily KM allowance, a rate for anything beyond it,
            and a refundable deposit. Those three numbers are listed against
            every car, so the price you agree is the price you pay.
          </p>
          <p>
            To rent, you need a valid driving licence and a government photo ID.
            The deposit is returned once the car comes back, less any extra-KM
            charges or damage.

          How we run a rental
        </h2>
        <div className="mt-4 space-y-5 leading-relaxed text-ink-dim">
          <p>
            Everything is agreed before the keys change hands. You are told the
            daily rate, the kilometre allowance, what a kilometre past it costs
            and what the deposit is — and none of those move afterwards. There
            is no booking fee on top, and nothing is worked out at the end that
            was not written down at the start.
          </p>
          <p>
            At handover the odometer reading and the fuel level are written
            down in front of you, and we walk round the vehicle together so
            that any mark already on it is a mark we both saw. The same check
            happens when it comes back. Five minutes at the start is what stops
            a disagreement at the end, and it protects you at least as much as
            it protects us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We deliver rather than asking you to collect. Give us an address
            and a time anywhere in {seo.site.district} district and the vehicle
            arrives there with its papers in it. On a long rental the servicing
            is ours to arrange, not yours, and if a vehicle has to go in for
            work we talk to you about a replacement rather than leaving you
            without one.
