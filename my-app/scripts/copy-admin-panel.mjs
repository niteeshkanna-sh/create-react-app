// Copies the PHP admin panel into the build output, so it ships with the site.
//
// Hostinger deploys this repository by running `npm run build` and serving
// my-app/dist. That means dist is the document root: anything not in it does
// not exist as far as the web is concerned, which is why niteshacars.in/admin
// returned the site's own "page not found" while the panel sat perfectly well
// in the repository.
//
// Vite copies public/ verbatim into dist/, so the panel could simply live
// there -- but public/ is for the website's own assets, and burying a PHP
// application inside it would be a surprise to anyone reading the tree. This
// copies it explicitly instead, after the build, where the intent is visible.
//
// config.php is never copied. It holds the database password, it is gitignored,
// and dist is rebuilt from scratch on every deploy -- so anything written into
// it is temporary by construction. The panel finds its configuration outside
// the build output; see config() in the panel's src/db.php.
