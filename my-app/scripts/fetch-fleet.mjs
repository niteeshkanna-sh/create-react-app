/**
 * Bakes the vehicle list into the build.
 *
 * The fleet lives in the admin panel's database and the site read it from the
 * browser, which meant the two pages that sell the business -- /cars and
 * /tariff -- were served to Google as "Fetching the current fleet…" and
 * "Loading the rate card…". Googlebot does render JavaScript, but it does so
 * on a second pass, days later, at its own discretion; and nothing else that
 * reads a page does it at all. A site competing for "Swift self drive
 * Nagercoil" cannot have the word Swift arrive after the crawl.
 *
 * So the list is fetched here, before Vite runs, and written into the bundle.
 * The browser still asks the panel on load, so a car added this morning still
 * appears this morning -- the baked copy is the floor, not the ceiling.
 *
 * Never fails the build, for the same reason fetch-content.mjs does not: a
 * shared host having a bad minute must not stop a deploy. If the panel cannot
 * be reached, whatever is already committed in fleet.json stays, and the log
 * says so.
 *
 * A rate of 0 means "not published here". It prints as "On request", never as
 * a figure -- a tariff is a promise, and one nobody at the business typed is
 * not a promise they can keep.
