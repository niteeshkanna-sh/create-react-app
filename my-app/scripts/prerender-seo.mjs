 * executes JavaScript and would eventually see the right ones, but WhatsApp,
 * Facebook, X and most other link unfurlers do not run it at all -- they read
 * the HTML as served and stop. Sharing niteshacars.in/tariff would preview as
 * the home page.
 *
 * So each route gets its own directory with its own index.html: same bundle,
 * same markup, but title, description, canonical and og: tags rewritten. Pages
 * serves /tariff/ from /tariff/index.html, and a request for /tariff without
 * the slash is redirected to it.
 *
 * dist/404.html stays a copy of the root page: it is what Pages serves for
 * anything unmatched, and the router resolves the URL once the app boots.
