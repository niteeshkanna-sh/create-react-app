/**
 * Which days each vehicle is already spoken for.
 *
 * So the date boxes can grey out — gold out, here — the days that cannot be
 * booked, rather than letting someone pick one and be told afterwards. The
 * conflict check in api/bookings.php still runs on save: this is the same
 * truth shown earlier, not a replacement for it.
 *
 * What it returns is days, and nothing else. No customer, no booking number,
 * no amount — a date being taken is ordinary availability information, the
 * kind any hire company publishes; who took it is not.
 *
 * BLOCKING_STATUSES rather than a list written out again here, so this and the
 * check that refuses a double booking can never disagree about what "taken"
 * means.
