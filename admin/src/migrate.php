/**

 * page. This runs it when there is any chance it is needed and skips it
 * otherwise.
 *
 * What decides "any chance" is the newest migration filename. A deploy that
 * adds one changes that string, so the next request after a deploy applies it
 * and every request after that skips. No version number to remember to bump.
 *
 * This exists because telling someone to "open the Dashboard tab" did not
 * work: the tabs are switched in JavaScript without loading the page, so the
 * migration that ran on page load never ran. An instruction that depends on
 * knowing that is not an instruction, it is a trap.
