/**
 * What the panel can be permitted to do, and who may do it.
 *
 * Three things live here, in this order, because each needs the one above it:
 *
 *   The catalogue -- every permission the panel actually checks, named once
 *   and written in the words of the business rather than the words of the
 *   code. 'payment.void' is what the server asks for; "Cancel a payment that
 *   was entered wrongly" is what somebody choosing it needs to read.
 *
 *   The roles -- what each of the five grants by default. This map used to sit
 *   in auth.php, which was the right place while a role was the whole answer.
 *   It is here now because it has become the starting point of an answer the
 *   rest of this file finishes.
 *
 *   The exceptions -- what one person may do that their role does not say, or
 *   may not do that it does. Stored per user, one row per difference.
 *
 * Deltas rather than a full copy, deliberately. "Staff, and may also take
 * payments" survives a change to what Staff means; a frozen snapshot of the
 * nine abilities Staff happened to have on the day the account was made does
 * not. It also reads correctly on the screen: two extras and one removal is a
 * sentence somebody can check, where twenty-seven ticks is not.
 *
 * One permission is deliberately absent from the catalogue: user.manage, the
 * one that opens the Users screen. It cannot be handed out a tick at a time,
 * because an account that holds it can reset the Super Admin's password and
 * take the panel. Giving somebody that is a decision to make them a Super
 * Admin -- a role change, which is visible in one word on the list -- and not
 * a checkbox in a group of twenty-seven that nobody rereads.
 */

/**
 * Every permission that something in the panel checks, grouped as the work is
 * grouped.
 *
 * The test for being in here is that some endpoint guards itself with it. A
 * permission that nothing enforces must not be offered: a tick that changes
 * nothing is worse than no tick, because somebody will rely on having removed
 * it.
