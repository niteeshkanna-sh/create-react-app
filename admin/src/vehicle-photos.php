 * Uploads go under storage_path, which sits above the document root. That is
 * not tidiness: this host deploys by rebuilding the web root from the
 * repository, so a photograph written inside it would be erased by the next
 * push. config.php was lost that way once already, and a customer-facing photo
 * disappearing on an unrelated deploy would be the same bug wearing different
 * clothes.
 *
 * Being outside the web root also means the file cannot be requested directly,
 * so photo.php reads and streams it. That costs a PHP process per image and
 * buys the guarantee that nothing in this directory is ever executed, whatever
 * ends up in it.
